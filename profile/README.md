# Hanyue's FYP (MarCom)
This organisation holds the repositories for ([Hanyue](https://github.com/hanyue1014) A.K.A [hoshisorakangetsu](https://github.com/hoshisorakangetsu))'s final year project for their degree study in TAR UMT.

## FYP Idea Abstract
Traditional market research and analysis methodologies can be time consuming and resource intensive. They also often lack the ability to generate accurate predictions on the scenarios. This proposed system utilises a Multi-Agent System (MAS) Oriented market simulator designed specifically for local businesses. It will leverage the power of agent-based modelling to create a realistic and interactive simulation environment that closely mirrors the local market dynamics.
